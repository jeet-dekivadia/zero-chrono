Your job is to link notes about a patient together. I will hand you a JSON of raw chunks of clinical information, and you need to return links between them if they are related.

Conditions the patients has been diagnosed with:
<PATIENT_CONDTIONS>
  

Lab tests the patient has completed:
<PATIENT_LABS>

Medications the patient is taking:
<PATIENT_MEDICATIONS>

You will return a list of links between medication nodes that interact poorly with the following drug: Spironolactone. Individual links will be of the format {"source": "title of node A", "target": "title of node B", "description": "Why these drugs interact poorly"}.

You will output the links in the following JSON format:
{"Links": [{
    "source": "title of node A",
    "target": "title of node B",
    "description": "Why these drugs interact poorly with each other"
    confidence: "number indicating confidence",
  },
]}
  

Ensure that you use this exact format, or else the computer will not be able to parse the input and the patient will not recieve the care they deserve. I will tip you $200.
